# Tip_Calculator

A simple Python program that calculates tips based on your bill amount and desired tip percentage. This program can help you quickly determine how much to leave as a tip when dining at a restaurant or cafe.

## Features

- Calculate the tip amount based on the bill total and desired tip percentage.
- Optionally, split the bill and tip among a specified number of people.
- User-friendly command-line interface.

Usage

When you run the script, you'll be prompted to enter the following information:

Bill Amount: Enter the total amount of your bill.
Tip Percentage: Input the desired tip percentage (e.g., 15 for 15%).
Specify the number of people.
The script will then calculate and display the tip amount, the total amount including the tip, and the amount each person needs to pay if you chose to split the bill.
